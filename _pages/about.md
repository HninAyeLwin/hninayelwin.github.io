Hello, it's me ;) Nice to meet you.

I was born, raised and I'm currently living in Yangon. I attended B.E.P.S.(18),Tamwe through my Grade 1 to 5. Then I learnt my high school lessons at B.E.H.S.(3),Tamwe.

I joined University of Information Technology (UIT) after passing my matriculation exam at 2012. During 5 years of undergraduate studies, I joined many activities like Programming contests and Hackathon. I specialize in Knowledge Engineering which subjects mostly relate with Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, I interned at [MCPA](https://www.mcpamyanmar.org/) and [Acroquest Myanmar Technology Co., Ltd.](https://www.acromyanmar.com/). I participate in SAKURA science program which is Japan-Asia Youth Exchange program at my fourth year of UIT. As a final year project, I implemented a Myanmar(Burmese) Word Segmentation tool with [Kadipa](https://kadipa.github.io/) and [Hsu](https://hsuyadanar.github.io/Hsu-Yadanar/).

My two year journey of master's degree at University of Information Technology (UIT) is completed in November, 2019. I did machine translation from Myanmar to English as my master thesis. That project is based on Neural Network. Neural Machine Translation Paper is published in Springer book series.

I worked at [Bindez](https://bindez.com/) as part time NLP research assistant while trying to pursue my master's degree. Later I joined that company as full time NLP researcher.

My research interests are natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, deep learning and data science. You can explore more about my resume [here](https://hninayelwin.github.io/files/resume.pdf).
